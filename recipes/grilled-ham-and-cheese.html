        <ol>
            <li>
                Make the honey mustard sauce by combining all ingredients in a bowl and stirring until smooth. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use (can be made in advance).
            </li>
            <li>
                Spread a thin layer of honey mustard sauce on the insides of the bread slices.
            </li>
            <li>
                Layer sandwiches with 3 slices of cheese (or more!) and a slice of ham.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat a skillet over medium-low heat. Butter the outsides of the sandwich bread.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the sandwich to the hot skillet and cook for 2-3 minutes, until golden. 
                Flip to the other side and cook for a few more minutes until cheese is melted and bread is golden brown. Serve warm, with honey mustard sauce for dipping.
